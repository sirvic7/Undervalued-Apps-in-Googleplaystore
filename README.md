# Undervalued-Apps-in-Googleplaystore

Introduction
As Data analysts, working for one of Google's data science teams and someone from another team, specifically an account manager who wants to improve the revenue of undervalued apps to motivate the developers to keep working on them.

Since her department's budget for marketing won't allow her to invest on ads (which would boost the number of sales), the only way to improve the revenue is by tweaking the price. She requests that you determine which paid apps are undervalued.

You talk it over with your manager and you come to the decision of prototyping this project, that is, making a rough analysis with some lax assumptions, instead of making a full-fledged analysis.
